# BET

BET wants you to make bets against yourself. Your only wager is what you think is true.

## Why Should I Bet Against Myself?

 We tend to make predictions about what would happen if we do something. That's fine but some if not most of us have biases that lowers the predictions' accuracy. Those imperfect predictions will normally make us not do anything when doing the opposite will actually benefit us more.

## How It Works

1. Set the prediction.
2. Do what's required to test your predictions.
3. Report your findings.
4. Enjoy the fact that you're a master of predictions and if not, make better ones next time.

## Principles

1. Unlike sites like [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) and [Good Judgement Open](https://www.gjopen.com/), BET is not interested in the state of the world but the state of you that inhabits that world.
2. Test the predictions in good faith. The results received would be much enjoyable and meaningful that way.
3. Have fun! BET is less about the truth, and more about the curiosity, surprise, and enjoyment felt along the path towards truth.
